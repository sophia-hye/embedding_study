2001,3.0,"passed in response to the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. The Act, the purpose of which was to deter and punish terrorist acts, was controversial for some of its far-reaching measures. Its key provisions involved powers of surveillance, regulation of financial transactions, and border security. It provided federal law enforcement and intelligence officials with expanded authority to track and intercept private communications, both within the United States and as part of foreign intelligence investigations. It increased the regulatory authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to prevent money laundering and broadened the definition of what constituted money laundering. It increased border security, especially between the United States and Canada, and expanded the authority of officials to deport foreign nationals. The Act also created new terrorism-related crimes. In 2005, Congress reauthorized the Patriot Act, making permanent many of the provisions which were set to expire, and adding safeguards to some provisions to prevent violations of civil liberties. In 2010, provisions of the Act that were set to expire were extended to 2011, and again in 2011 to extend to 2015."

In addition to other changes, it eliminated the requirement that works to be copyrighted be deposited with the Library of Congress, and it changed the term of copyright from 28 years with a single renewal to the life of the author plus 50 years (with certain exceptions). It also broadened categories of materials that may be copyrighted, stating that copyright subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression. Such works include literary, musical, and dramatic works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings and computer software. The Act clarified the conventions of fair use; specified proper copyright notification (usually the symbol © or the word “Copyright”); established the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to oversee cable television and jukebox licensing of copyrighted works, in accordance with royalty rates set by the tribunal; placed limitations on the use of copyrighted works by libraries and educational institutions; and established a mechanism for review of issues pertaining to computer software."

1986,4.0,"revised federal tax laws and created the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act eliminated various tax loopholes for high-income earners and reduced the highest rates for both businesses and individuals. The intent of the Act was to achieve a “level playing field.” The rate reductions were to be made up by increased restrictions on deductions for corporate capital expenditures and a repeal of the investment tax credit. Corporate taxes were thus expected to increase $120 billion in five years, which they generally did. The act also removed over four million low-income individuals from the tax rolls and made unemployment compensation taxable. Tax reform took place previously in 1976, 1981, and 1984. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 included, among other changes, new provisions relating to childcare and child support, and instituted new laws relating to capital gains and losses, including the one-time exclusion from capital gains tax on the sale of a residence. In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (q.v.) was enacted. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 was aimed at reducing the federal deficit. Among its provisions were tax exemptions for certain fringe benefits, stricter rules regarding deductions for charitable donations, and the creation of tax advantages to corporations to encourage exports. These efforts to amend federal tax laws were followed by the sweeping changes brought by the Tax Reform Act of 1986."

Obergefell,1.0,"576 U.S. _____ (2015), held that the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry, and that States must recognize same-sex marriages validly performed out of state. The case followed divided state and federal legislative actions and judicial decisions on the issue of same-sex marriage. In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined “marriage” for purposes of federal law as a legal union between one man and one woman and which declared that no state was required to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. ____ (2013), holding that it deprived same-sex couples of equal liberty guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in imposing a disadvantage, separate status, and stigma on couples in same-sex marriages that were lawful in their state of residence. The Court did not, however, answer the question of the legality of same-sex marriage, continuing to leave it to the states. In Obergefell, the Court reviewed consolidated suits brought by fourteen same-sex couples in the Sixth Circuit, which had ruled against them. In a 5–4 decision, the Court held that states are required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and that they must recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another state. It reasoned that personal choice regarding marriage is a fundamental liberty inherent in the concept of individual autonomy and is guaranteed to same-sex couples just as to heterosexual couples under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause and equal protection clause. In further support of its decision, the court cited precedent holding that marriage is unlike any other in importance to the committed individuals, that it safeguards children and families, and that it is the keystone of our social order. The Court stated that while the First Amendment guarantees religious organizations the right to their principles, states are not afforded the right to discriminate against same-sex couples."
